## QBS App for Krissy

App to join prospective QBS candidates with faculty and/or alumni for interviews.

1.) current master input file is input_file.xlsx

2.) current scheduling output file (for download) is final_output.xlsx

3.) faculty and alumni are only available for certain hours on certain days and ideally
each candidate will be matched with with both of their desired faculty/alumni.

4.) First, we assure that the candidates number one choice is met, then second choice takes precedance,
if matched can't be made based on availability, then random assignments are made.  

5.) See "Issues" section for current issues or bugs that need to be addressed. 

6.) Shiny App interface under construction at https://michael-p-mariani.shinyapps.io/qbs_app/
