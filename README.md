## QBS App for Krissy

App to join prospective QBS candidates with faculty and/or alumni for interviews.

faculty and aluni are only available for certain hours on certain days and ideally
each candidate will be matched with with both of their desired faculty alumni.

First, we assure that the candidates number one choice is met, then second choice takes precadance,
if matched can't be made based on availability, then random assignments are made.  

Current input is input_mm.xlsx - final input formatting needs to be decided by Krissy at her convenience, 
as well as the format of the final output file: final_output.xlsx and desired alterations to the shiny interface. 

See "Issues" section for current issues or bugs that need to be addressed.
